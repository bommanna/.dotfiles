General configuration folder
============================

Used to put configuration options when possible.

Currently there are two special folders:

* ``git``, git configuration, under version control
* ``vim``, Vim configuration, under version control
* ``extra``, any of the following files will be sourced by the appropriate 
  executable if it exists:

  * ``.bashrc``
  * ``.vimperatorrc``
